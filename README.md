Hello All.
I am Mahnoor Malik
I am an electrical engineering student and currently on the way of becoming a software developer.
I have started by the concepts of JAVA, PYTHON, C++, HTML, CSS OOP and SQL.
I have started the practice phase and made this account for a lot of help plus accountability for myself. 
Hoping to have a productive and pleasant journey.
